## Mail + Miming

If you don't  know what that means, then you're not the intended audience.

This is a "private" blog made to emulate snail mail between two people. 

> Why not just email/message that person directly? 

The idea is for us (the aforementioned two people) to *indirectly* communicate in a second language that is not native to me. 

Taking notifications and read receipts out of the equation makes the possibility of embarassing ourselves in a language we don't normally use together less intimidating in my mind. And it's a good excuse to get into some long-form writing that seems cumbersome in other mediums of casual communication.
