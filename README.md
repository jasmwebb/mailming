This is a "private" blog (is there such thing as true privacy on the internet?) made to emulate snail mail between two people, myself being one of them. 

> Why not just email/message that person directly? 

The idea is for the aforementioned two people to *indirectly* communicate in a second language that is not their primary language of communication, as a means of language practice.

Taking notifications and read receipts out of the equation makes the possibility of embarrassment less intimidating. Additionally, writing in a medium not catered towards instant communication removes the pressure of having to write quickly, and encourages long-form writing.
