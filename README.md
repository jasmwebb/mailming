## Mail + Miming

If you don't  know what that means, then you're not the intended audience.

This is a "private" blog made to emulate snail mail between two people. 

> Why not just email/message that person directly? 

The idea is for us (the aforementioned two people) to *indirectly* communicate in a second language that is not native to me. 

Given this is a language we don't normally use together, taking notifications and read receipts out of the equation makes the possibility of embarassing ourselves less intimidating. Additionally, writing in a medium not catered towards instant communication removes the pressure of having to write quickly.
